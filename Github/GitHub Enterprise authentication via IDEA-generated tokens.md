### CONTEXT:

There is a GitHub Enterprise repository you have access to, and you have to clone it. 
However, dealing with SSH keys is sort of a hassle and you'd want to set up simpler authentication method.

### SOLUTION:

1. IN Intellij IDEA start screen, 
    SELECT 'Get from VCS' & SELECT 'GitHub Enterprise' & SELECT 'Generate Token'. 

(NOTE: You'd have to align with GHE with the token next, I don't remember the eact steps but it should be self-explanatory)
