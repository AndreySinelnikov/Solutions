### CONTEXT 

When creating issues, for example, you get too many unnecessary fields to fill. You'd want to remove them.

### SOLUTION 

1. IN upper navigation bar, SELECT 'Settings' > 'Issues' > 'Screens'

2. IN 'Screens' window 'Name' column, SELECT desired screen (EXAMPLE: 'Default screen'; applies to all issues across projects)
