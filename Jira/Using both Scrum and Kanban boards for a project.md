### CONTEXT:

You'd want to switch between Scrum and Kanban approaches during work on your project.

### SOLUTION:

When creating Jira project, choose Company-managed Scrum template. 
_(In fact, always choose Company-managed, Team-managed is useless)._

Then, in Planning menu, click current board name and select "Create board" in the dropdown menu.
Select a Kanban template and name it. 

Now you'll have an option to switch between boards (views, really) while interacting with the same set of issues
without much filter hassle.
