Some corporate resources you're working with might need proxy/VPN to access. 
However, it also might not be preferable to keep your proxy/VPN up at all times.

Since it makes sense to have such resources bookmarked, 
it also would be useful to prepend names of the bookmarks for resources that need proxy/VPN with mnemonic prefixes.
