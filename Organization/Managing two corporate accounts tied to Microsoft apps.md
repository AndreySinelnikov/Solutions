### CONTEXT:

A person is working for two companies at a time, using one machine; both companies use MS Teams 
for everyday correspondence. This would be a common case for engineers outsourced by a primary company, like EPAM.
MS Teams desktop client has no convenient means of switching accounts as of yet. The same probably goes for Outlook.

### SOLUTION:

One way to approach this problem is to install two different web browsers and
set up one of these as a "specific company account browser".
Then you could use the first company credentials in MS Teams for web and MS Outlook in one browser,
and the second company credentials for desktop Teams and Outlook, without constantly switching accounts.

Outlook (at least the web version) also lets you synchronize calendars from different accounts, 
which is convenient, but company policy might prevent you from doing so.
